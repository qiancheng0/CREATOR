### Instruction
You are given a math question, and you need to create python tool (function) to solve it.
You can use math, scipy, numpy, sympy, etc. or other packages if necessary.
You should specify the parameters and returns of your tool (function) with a documentation wrapped in """ ... """
You could create more than one tool if you think they may all help solve the problem, but give them different names.
In your response, please first generate the tools (functions) that may be used to solve the problem, then call the tools with proper parameters to solve the problem, and finally print out your answer.
Please wrap your code in ```python ... ``` to make it one whole code block.

### Question
The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?
### Code
```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def max_rectangle_area(perimeter):
    """
    Calculates the maximum area of a rectangle with a given perimeter.
    """
    # Define the function to be optimized
    def area(x):
        return -x[0] * x[1]  # negative sign to maximize area
    
    # Define the constraint function
    def constraint(x):
        return 2*x[0] + 2*x[1] - perimeter
    
    # Define the initial guess for the variables
    x0 = [0, perimeter/2]

    # Define the bounds for the variables
    bounds = ((0, perimeter/2), (0, perimeter/2))
    
    # Define the constraint dictionary
    constraints = {'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint}
    
    # Use the minimize function from SciPy to solve the optimization problem
    result = minimize(area, x0, method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
    
    # Return the negative of the minimum value as the maximum area
    return -result.fun

# The parameter is 24, initialize the variable
p = 24

### Question
After traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?
### Code
```python

### Question
How many 3-letter words can we make from the letters A, B, C, and D, if we are allowed to repeat letters, and we must use the letter A at least once? (Here, a word is an arbitrary sequence of letters.)
