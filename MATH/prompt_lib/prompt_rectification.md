### Instruction
Your original codes have met some errors when executing, please rectify your codes.
You should generate the whole one new piece of code, instead of generating a snippet.
Wrap your code in ```python\n ... \n``` to make it a one whole code block.
Pay attention to the conditions in question before modifying.
Your goal is answer the question correctly instead of just execute the code successfully.
If necessary, you can also generate a whole new tool. Change your way of thinking to solve the problem.

### Question
Please calculate the square root of a and b to get c, where a = 4 and b = 9.
### Original Codes
```python
def calculate_c(a, b):
    """
    The function calculate c, which is the aquare root of a multiply b
    """
    c = math.sqrt(a * b)
a = 4
b = 9
c = calculate_c(a, b)
print("The value of c is", c)
```
### Error Information
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_code0.py", line 9, in <module>
    c = calculate_c(a, b)
  File "test_code0.py", line 5, in calculate_c
    c = math.sqrt(a * b)
NameError: name 'math' is not defined
### Rectified Code
The math is not defined, so I should add the math module before the tool.
In detail, I should add `import math` at the very beginning.
```python
# Modify here to import at the beginning
import math
def calculate_c(a, b):
    """
    The function calculate c, which is the aquare root of a multiply b
    """
    c = math.sqrt(a * b)
a = 4
b = 9
c = calculate_c(a, b)
print("The value of c is", c)
```

### Question
Students who like to play basket ball is 5, who like to play soccer is 10. The total number of students is 12. Please calculate the percentage of students who like to play both sports.
### Original Codes
```python
def percentage(basketball, soccer):
    """
    The function calculate the percentage of students who like to play both sports
    """
    both = basketball + soccer - total
    percentage = (both / total) * 100
    return percentage
basketball = 5
soccer = 10
percent = percentage(basketball, soccer)
print("The percentage of students who like to play both sports is", percent)
```
### Error Information
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_code1.py", line 11, in <module>
    percent = percentage(basketball, soccer)
  File "test_code1.py", line 5, in percentage
    both = basketball + soccer - total
NameError: name 'total' is not defined
### Rectified Code
The total is not defined in the tool. It is given in the question.
Maybe I should pass one more given condition into it, so that the tool can work.
I should also initialize the total given in the question, it should be 12.
```python
# Modify the tool to give one more parameter into it, so the `total` is defined now 
def percentage(basketball, soccer, total):
    """
    The function calculate the percentage of students who like to play both sports
    """
    both = basketball + soccer - total
    percentage = (both / total) * 100
    return percentage
basketball = 5
soccer = 10
total = 12
percent = percentage(basketball, soccer, total)
print("The percentage of students who like to play both sports is", percent)
```

### Question
There are some res, bule and yellow balls in the box. The number of red ball is twice the number of blue ball, and the number of yellow ball is 3 times the number of blue ball. The total number of balls is 24. How many red ball are there in the box?
### Original Codes
```python
def redball(total):
    """
    It takes in the total number of ball and return the number of red balls
    """
    total = red + blue + yellow
    yellow = 3 * blue
    red = 2 * blue
    return red
total = 24
red_number = redball(total)
print("The number of red balls in total is", red_number)
```
### Error Information
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_code2.py", line 10, in <module>
    red_number = redball(total)
  File "test_code2.py", line 5, in redball
    total = red + blue + yellow
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'red' referenced before assignment
### Rectified Code
The red, blue and yellow are not defined in the tool. They are also not given in the question, only a total number is given.
Maybe I should change a way to solve the problem.
I can change to a new tool. In the tool, I can let the number of blue ball be `x`, use sympy to solve an equation and return the number of red ball which is `2x`.
```python
# Here I modify the tool as a whole, to solve this problem in another way.
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_balls_problem(total):
    """
    It takes in the total number of ball and return the number of red balls
    The function uses sympy to solve the problem
    """
    x = symbols('x')
    eq = Eq(x + 2*x + 3*x, total)
    x_value = solve(eq)[0]
    red_balls = 2 * x_value
    return red_balls
total_number = 24
red_number = solve_balls_problem(total_number)
print("The number of red balls in total is", red_number)
```
