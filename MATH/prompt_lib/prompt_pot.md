### Question
The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?
### Solution code
```python
# The parameter is 24, initialize the variable
p = 24
# To maximuize the area, we nned to let the length and width be as close as possible
length = width = p/4
# Calculate the area
max_area = length * width
# print the answer
print("Final Answer:", max_area)
```

### Question
Point $P$ lies on the line $x= -3$ and is 10 units from the point $(5,2)$. Find the product of all possible $y$-coordinates that satisfy the given conditions.
### Solution code
```python
import math
# initilize the coordinates
x1 = -3
x2 = 5
y = 2
# initialize the distance
d = 10
# calculate 2 y-coordinates using the Pythagorean Theorem
y_possible1 = y + math.sqrt(d**2 - (x2 - x1)**2)
y_possible2 = y - math.sqrt(d**2 - (x2 - x1)**2)
# calculate the product
product = y_possible1 * y_possible2
print("Answer Final:", product)
```

### Question
If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?
### Solution code
```python
# Define the coefficients
a = 3
b = 4
c = 8
d = 4
e = 3
f = 13
# Solve for q in terms of p using elimination method
q = (c*d - a*f) / (b*d - a*e)
# Print the solution
print("Final Answer:", q)
```

### Question
After traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?
### Solution code
```python
# Set up the proportion
fare_1 = 120
distance_1 = 50
distance_2 = 70
# Calculate the fare
fare_2 = fare_1 * (distance_2 / distance_1)
# Print the result
print("Final Answer:", fare_2)
```

### Question
How many 3-letter words can we make from the letters A, B, C, and D, if we are allowed to repeat letters, and we must use the letter A at least once? (Here, a word is an arbitrary sequence of letters.)
### Solution code
```python
# initialize variables
letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
word_length = 3
count = 0
# loop through all possible combinations of letters and count the ones that meet the criteria
for i in letters:
    for j in letters:
        for k in letters:
            word = i+j+k
            if "A" in word:
                count += 1
# print the count
print("Final Answer:", count)
```

### Question
What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?
### Solution code
```python
import math
# Given face areas
face1 = 24
face2 = 16
face3 = 6
# Solving for the dimensions using the equations derived above
a = math.sqrt(face1 * face3 / face2)
b = math.sqrt(face1 * face2 / face3)
c = math.sqrt(face2 * face3 / face1)
# Calculating the volume
volume = a * b * c
# Printing the result
print("Final Answer:", volume)
```

### Question
Compute the sum of elements in $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & - 1 \\ - 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ - 1 \end{pmatrix}.$
### Solution code
```python
import numpy as np
# Define the matrix and the vector
A = np.array([[2, -1], [-3, 4]])
B = np.array([[3], [-1]])
# Compute the product of the matrix and the vector using np.dot()
C = np.dot(A, B)
# Compute the sum of the elements in the resulting vector using np.sum()
sum_of_elements = np.sum(C)
# Print the result
print("Final Answer:", sum_of_elements)
```
