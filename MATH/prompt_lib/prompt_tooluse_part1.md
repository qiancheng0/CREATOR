### Instruction
You are given a math competition question.
You could call WolframAlpha API to help you solve the question.
After seeing a question, you should first generate thoughts and think about how to call the API.
Generate "WOLFRAM:" in the last line of your response with appropriate inputs you'd like to inquiry.

### Question
The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?
### Response
To find the maximum possible area of a rectangle with perimeter 24 inches, we need to find the dimensions that maximize the area. Let the length and width of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$, respectively.
From the perimeter, we know that $2l + 2w = 24$, which simplifies to $l+w=12$. We can rearrange this equation to get $l = 12-w$.
The area of the rectangle is $A = lw = w(12-w) = 12w-w^2$. This is a quadratic function with a maximum value at the vertex. We want to find the maximum value of this equation.
WOLFRAM: maximize 12x-x^2


### Question
Point $P$ lies on the line $x= -3$ and is 10 units from the point $(5,2)$. Find the product of all possible $y$-coordinates that satisfy the given conditions.
### Response
Let the y-coordinate of point $P$ be denoted by $y$.
Since $P$ lies on the line $x=-3$, we know that the coordinates of $P$ are $(-3,y)$.
Since $P$ is 10 units from the point $(5,2)$, we can use the distance formula to write an equation:
$\sqrt{(-3-5)^2+(y-2)^2}=10$
We can call wolframalpha to solve this equation
WOLFRAM: solve sqrt((-3-5)^2+(y-2)^2)=10

### Question
If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?
### Response
Directly use WolframAlpha API to solve the equation:
WOLFRAM: solve 3p+4q=8, 4p+3q=13

### Question
After traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?
### Response
Let x be the amount Ann would be charged (in dollars) if she traveled 70 miles. We can set up a proportion to solve for x:
50/120 = 70/x
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = (70 * 120) / 50
We can call wolframalpha to solve for the final answer
WOLFRAM: (70 * 120) / 50

### Question
How many 3-letter words can we make from the letters A, B, C, and D, if we are allowed to repeat letters, and we must use the letter A at least once? (Here, a word is an arbitrary sequence of letters.)
### Response
To count the number of 3-letter words we can make from A, B, C, and D, we can use the multiplication principle. We have 4 choices for each of the three positions in the word, so there are a total of $4^3$ possible 3-letter words we can make if we are allowed to repeat letters and don't have any restrictions.
The number of words that do not contain the letter A is $3^3$, since we have 3 choices for each position in the word, and we can't use the letter A.
WOLFRAM: 4^3 - 3^3

### Question
What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?
### Response
To find the volume of the rectangular box, we need to multiply the three side lengths:
V=xyz
We can use the information given in the problem to find the side lengths:
xy=24
xz=16
yz=6
Multiplying these equations together, we get:
(xy)(xz)(yz)=24⋅16⋅6
Simplifying, we have:
(xyz)^2=24⋅16⋅6
We can call wolfram now for the pure calculation.
WOLFRAM: sqrt(24*16*6)

### Question
Compute the sum of elements in $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & - 1 \\ - 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ - 1 \end{pmatrix}.$
### Response
We first need to multiply the matrix, we can use the API to get the multiplication result.
WOLFRAM: {{2, -1}, {-3, 4}} * {3, -1}
