### Question
The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?
### Thoughts and Answer
Let the length and width of the rectangle be denoted by l and w, respectively.
Given, perimeter of the rectangle = 24 inches
i.e., 2(l + w) = 24
=> l + w = 12
We need to find the maximum possible area of the rectangle, which is given by A = lw.
Using the constraint that the perimeter is 24, we can rewrite l + w = 12 as l = 12 - w.
Substituting this expression for l in the equation for the area, we get A = w(12 - w) = 12w - w^2.
We want to find the value of w that maximizes the area. To do this, we can take the derivative of A with respect to w and set it equal to zero:
dA/dw = 12 - 2w = 0
=> w = 6
To confirm that this gives us a maximum area, we can take the second derivative of A with respect to w:
d^2A/dw^2 = -2 < 0
Since the second derivative is negative, we know that w = 6 corresponds to a maximum value of A.
To find the value of the maximum area, we can substitute w = 6 back into the expression for A:
A = 6(12 - 6) = 36
Final Answer: 36

### Question
Point $P$ lies on the line $x= -3$ and is 10 units from the point $(5,2)$. Find the product of all possible $y$-coordinates that satisfy the given conditions.
### Thoughts and Answer
Let the y-coordinate of point $P$ be denoted by $y$.
Since $P$ lies on the line $x=-3$, we know that the coordinates of $P$ are $(-3,y)$.
Since $P$ is 10 units from the point $(5,2)$, we can use the distance formula to write an equation:
$\sqrt{(-3-5)^2+(y-2)^2}=10$
Simplifying the equation gives us:
$(y-2)^2+64=100$
$(y-2)^2=36$
$y-2=\pm6$
$y=8$ or $y=-4$
Therefore, the possible $y$-coordinates that satisfy the given conditions are $8$ and $-4$.
The product of these values is $8 \times (-4) = -32$.
Final Answer: -32

### Question
If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?
### Thoughts and Answer
We can use elimination method to solve for $p$ and $q$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4, we get:
9p+12q=24
16p+12q=52
Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
7p=28
Therefore, $p=4$. Substituting $p=4$ into either of the original equations, we get:
3(4)+4q=8
Solving for $q$, we get:
4q=−4
q=−1
Final Answer: -1

### Question
After traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?
### Thoughts and Answer
Let x be the amount Ann would be charged (in dollars) if she traveled 70 miles. We can set up a proportion to solve for x:
50/120 = 70/x
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = (70 * 120) / 50
x = 168
Therefore, Ann would be charged $168 if she traveled 70 miles.
Final Answer: 168

### Question
How many 3-letter words can we make from the letters A, B, C, and D, if we are allowed to repeat letters, and we must use the letter A at least once? (Here, a word is an arbitrary sequence of letters.)
### Thoughts and Answer
Case 1: A appears once.
In this case, we have two letters to choose from for the other two positions (B, C, or D). We can choose each of these letters in 3 ways, since we can repeat them. A can be at one of the three places. Therefore, there are 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 possible words in this case.
Case 2: A appears twice.
In this case, we have one letter to choose from for the remaining position (B, C, or D). We can choose this letter in 3 ways, since we can repeat it. The remaining position can be the fisr, second ir the third one. Therefore, there are 3 × 3 = 9 possible words in this case.
Case 3: A appears three times.
In this case, there is only one possible word: AAA.
Therefore in total there are 27 + 9 + 1 = 37 possible words.
Final Answer: 37

### Question
What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?
### Thoughts and Answer
To find the volume of the rectangular box, we need to multiply the three side lengths:
V=xyz
We can use the information given in the problem to find the side lengths:
xy = 24
xz = 16
yz = 6
Multiplying these equations together, we get:
(xy)(xz)(yz)=24⋅16⋅6
Simplifying, we have:
(xyz)^2=24⋅16⋅6=2034
​Therefore,
xyz=48
Final Answer: 48

### Question
Compute the sum of elements in $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & - 1 \\ - 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ - 1 \end{pmatrix}.$
### Thoughts and Answer
We first multiply the matrices and get:
first element = 2 * 3 + (-1) * (-1) = 7
second element = (-3) * 3 + 4 * (-1) = -13
So the sum of elements is 7 + (-13) = -6.
Final Answer: -6
