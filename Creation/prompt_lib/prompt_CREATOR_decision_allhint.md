### Problem
What's the least number of time should I do /N or -1 to get 0 from 17?
### Constants
N (int): the number to divide, we set it to 2 in this problem.
### Hints
You might use the following hints about what tool to create
Utility:
The tool should take a start number as input, do operations and accumulate the count, and return the count.
Args:
start_number (int): the starting number to do operation only
Returns:
count (int): The least number of operations needed
### Tool
```python
def strategy_count(start_number: int) -> int:
    """
    This tool returns the number of times we should do /2 or -1 to get 0 from start_number.
    Args:
    start_number (int): the starting number
    Returns:
    count (int): The least number of operations needed
    """
    x = start_number
    count = 0
    while True:
        if x == 0:
            return count
        # We can directly use the constant value 2 here
        if x % 2 == 0:
            x = x / 2
        else:
            x = x - 1
        count += 1
```
### Response
```python
# Call the strategy to solve the problem
count = strategy_count(17)
# print out the answer
print("The least number of operations neded is", count)
```
