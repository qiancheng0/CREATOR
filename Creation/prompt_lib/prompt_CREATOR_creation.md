You are asked to use python code to create a tool that is helpful in solving the problem.
You should create a tool with documentation. state the utility, input and output clearly in your documentation.
You can leverge other python packages in your tool created. You can also directly use the constant information.

### Problem
What's the least number of time should I do /N or -1 to get 0 from 17?
### Constants
N (int): the number to divide, we set it to 2 in this problem.
### Response
```python
def strategy_count(start_number: int) -> int:
    """
    The tool is created to mimic the operation using the strategy of /2 when even and -1 when odd.
    Utility:
    This tool returns the number of times we should do /2 or -1 to get 0 from start_number.
    Args:
    start_number (int): the starting number
    Returns:
    count (int): The least number of operations needed
    """
    x = start_number
    count = 0
    while True:
        if x == 0:
            return count
        # We can directly use the constant value 2 here
        if x % 2 == 0:
            x = x / 2
        else:
            x = x - 1
        count += 1
