### Instruction
Your original codes have met some errors when executing, please rectify your codes.
You should generate the whole one new piece of code, instead of generating a snippet.
Wrap your code in ```python\n ... \n``` to make it a one whole code block.
Pay attention to the conditions in question before modifying.
Your goal is answer the question correctly instead of just execute the code successfully.
If necessary, you can also generate a whole new tool. Change your way of thinking to solve the problem.

### Problem
What's the least number of time should I do /N or -1 to get 0 from 17?
### Constants
N (int): the number to divide, we set it to 2 in this problem.
### Original Codes
```python
def strategy_count(start_number: int) -> int:
    """
    The function returns the number of times we should do /2 or -1 to get 0 from start_number.
    Args:
    start_number (int): the starting number
    Returns:
    count (int): The least number of operations needed
    """
    x = start_number
    while True:
        if x == 0:
            return count
        # We can directly use the constant value 2 here
        if x % 2 == 0:
            x = x / 2
        else:
            x = x - 1
        count += 1

# Call the strategy to solve the problem
count = strategy_count(17)
# print out the answer
print("The least number of operations neded is", count)
```
### Error Information
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 21, in <module>
    count = strategy_count(17)
  File "test.py", line 18, in strategy_count
    count += 1
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'count' referenced before assignment
### Rectified Code
It seems that the error occured because I haven't define variable `count` in the tool. I should add the definition of it. Here is the new rectified codes.
```python
def strategy_count(start_number: int) -> int:
    """
    The function returns the number of times we should do /2 or -1 to get 0 from start_number.
    Args:
    start_number (int): the starting number
    Returns:
    count (int): The least number of operations needed
    """
    # Modified here, add definition of count before using it.
    count = 0
    x = start_number
    while True:
        if x == 0:
            return count
        # We can directly use the constant value 2 here
        if x % 2 == 0:
            x = x / 2
        else:
            x = x - 1
        count += 1

# Call the strategy to solve the problem
count = strategy_count(17)
# print out the answer
print("The least number of operations neded is", count)
```
