You are asked to use python code to create a tool that is helpful in solving the problem. (with constant information that might be used)
You are given a piece of hint about what tool you should create, including the args, returns and its utility.
After seeing the question, you should create a tool with documentation. state the utility, input and output clearly in your documentation.
You can leverge other python packages in your tool created. You can also directly use the constant information.
Please only generate the tool, do not run it and do not give its usage.
Please wrap your tool in ```python ... ``` in your response.

### Problem
What's the least number of time should I do /N or -1 to get 0 from 17?
### Constants
N (int): the number to divide, we set it to 2 in this problem.
### Hints
You might use the following hints about what tool to create
Utility:
The tool should take a start number as input, do operations and accumulate the count, and return the count.
Args:
start_number (int): the starting number to do operation only
Returns:
count (int): The least number of operations needed
### Response
```python
def strategy_count(start_number: int) -> int:
    """
    This tool returns the number of times we should do /2 or -1 to get 0 from start_number.
    Args:
    start_number (int): the starting number
    Returns:
    count (int): The least number of operations needed
    """
    x = start_number
    count = 0
    while True:
        if x == 0:
            return count
        # We can directly use the constant value 2 here
        if x % 2 == 0:
            x = x / 2
        else:
            x = x - 1
        count += 1
```
