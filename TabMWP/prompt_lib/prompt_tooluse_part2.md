### Question
This is Akira's complete financial record for August. What's difference between the amount of money Akira received and the amount of money Akira spent?
### Response
To find the difference between the amount of money Akira received and the amount of money Akira spent, I need to calculate the total amount received and subtract the total amount spent. From the table, the total amount received is $58.65, and the total amount spent is $6.50 and $23.40. We can call the API to help calculate the difference.
WOLFRAM: absolute { 58.65-(6.50+23.40) }
### WolframAlpha Return
[{'@title': 'Input', 'subpod': {'@title': '', 'plaintext': 'abs(58.65 - (6.5 + 23.4))'}, {'@title': 'Result', '@primary': 'true', 'subpod': {'@title': '', 'plaintext': '28.75'}}]
### Response Continue

A candy dispenser put various numbers of orange candies into bags. What's the totol number of candies in the bags?
### Response
To find the total number of orange candies in the bags, I need to add up the values. The stem represents the tens digit of the number of candies in the bag, and the leaf represents the ones digit of the number of candies in the bag. We can call the API to help calculate the sum.

### WolframAlpha Return
[{'@title': 'Input', 'subpod': {'@title': '', 'plaintext': 'total | {22, 23, 29, 50, 56, 57, 59, 60, 71, 73, 79, 85}'}}, {'@title': 'Result', '@primary': 'true', 'subpod': {'@title': '', '@primary': 'true', 'plaintext': '664'}}]
### Response Continue
The sum of all the values is 664.
Final Answer: 664

### Table

3 | 20
### Question
Some students compared how many pairs of boots they own. How many students own fewer than 2 pairs of boots?
### Response
To find the number of students who own fewer than 2 pairs of boots, I need to add up the frequency of the students who own 0 pairs of boots and 1 pair of boots. From the table, the frequency of students who own 0 pairs of boots is 12 and the frequency of students who own 1 pair of boots is 17. We can call the API to help calculate the sum.
WOLFRAM: 12+17
### WolframAlpha Return
[{'@title': 'Input', 'subpod': {'@title': '', 'plaintext': '12 + 17'}}, {'@title': 'Result', '@primary': 'true', 'subpod': {'@title': '', 'plaintext': '29'}, ...]
### Response Continue
