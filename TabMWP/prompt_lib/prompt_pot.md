### Table
Name: Orange candies per bag
Unit: bags
Content:
Stem | Leaf 
2 | 2, 3, 9
3 |

6 | 0
7 | 1, 3, 9
8 | 5
### Question
A candy dispenser put various numbers of orange candies into bags. How many bags had at least 32 orange candies?
### Solution code
```python
data = {
    2: [2, 3, 9],
    3: [],
    4: [],
    5: [0, 6, 7, 9],
    6: [0],
    7: [1, 3, 9],
    8: [5]
}
# Initialize the count to zero
count = 0
# Iterate over the keys in the dictionary
for key in data:
    # Combine tenth digit and unit digit
    if key * 10 + data[key] >= 32:
        # Increment the count
        count += 1

# Output the result
print(count, "bags had at least 32 orange candies.")
```

### Table
Name: None
Unit: $
Content:
Number of pairs of boots | Frequency
0 | 12
1 | 17
2 | 7
3 | 20
### Question
Some students compared how many pairs of boots they own. How many students own fewer than 2 pairs of boots?
### Solution code
```python
data = {
    0: 12,
    1: 17,
    2: 7,
    3: 20
}
# Initialize the count to zero
count = 0
# Iterate over the keys in the dictionary
for key in data:
    # Check if the key is less than 2
    if key < 2:
        # Increment the count by the value of the key
        count += data[key]

# Output the result
print(count, "students own fewer than 2 pairs of boots.")
```
