### Question
A candy dispenser put various numbers of orange candies into bags. How many bags had at least 32 orange candies?
### Thoughts and Answer
To determine the number of bags that have at least 32 orange candies, we need to analyze the given data in the table.
We know that the stem of 3 and 4does not have any associated leaves, so we can ignore that row. We should then combine the stem and leaf of 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
After combining, we get the number of candies in bag is 22, 23, 29, 50, 56, 57, 59, 60, 71, 73, 79 and 85. Among these there are 9 bags with at least 32 orange candies.
